2. Run the `Shiwulu.OpenDownload.jar` file to launch the GUI interface for the download program.
> If double-clicking does not open the GUI, please open a bash terminal and run ``java -jar Shiwulu.OpenDownload.jar``
3. Enter the download link and the save path in the interface, and click the start button to begin the download.

## Notes

- Ensure that the system has sufficient disk space to save the downloaded files.
- When errors occur during the download process, the program will display error messages and provide corresponding solution suggestions.
- In some cases, using links from Baidu Cloud or GitHub may cause errors in the program. Please try to avoid using these links for download.
- **Always keep up with the latest version**, as the latest version may contain important security and quality patches.
- The author **strongly recommends against using versions affected by Log4j2**, as this could lead to serious incidents.
- The minimum required Java version for running the tool is 1.8 (Java 8). Running on versions lower than this may lead to compatibility issues.
